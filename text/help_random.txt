`@Oifey random` - Picks a random character from the main games or Heroes.

And you can pick a character from a specific region:

`@Oifey random archanea`
Only the first words needs to be the region's name, everything else doesn't matter.

Available regions: `archanea` `askr` `fateslandia` `ylisse` `elibe` `magvel` `valentia` `jugdral` `tellius` `fodlan` `saga` `tokyo`

Also works with slash commands:

`/random`

**Disabling random commands**

To disable it in a channel, type `o!NoRandom` (uppercase and lowercase letters matter!) in the topic of the channel. 
All random commands will be disabled, and the bot will not find any entries if used in a game command (ex. `@Oifey feh random`).

To enable it again, just remove `o!NoRandom` from the channel's topic.
